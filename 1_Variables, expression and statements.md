## 1. First python program for BAIT, Arithmetic operators

**Python for Arithmetic**
- As BAIT student, arithmetic or calculation is important. So instead of using "Hello, World!" as the first python program, let us use python as a calculator.
- Python provides operators, which are special symbols that represent computations like addition and multiplication.
- The operators +, -, * , and /  perform addition, subtraction, and multiplication, as in the following examples:
```python
>>> 10/2
5
>>> 10 + 2
12
>>> 10 * 10
100
```
- Exponentiation. To calculate $6^2+3$
```python
>>> 6**2 + 3
39

>>> 2 * 3 ** 2
18
```



## 2. Assignment statement  and variables

**Assignment statements**
- An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it value. For example,
```python
>>> n = 388
>>> n
388

>>> message = 'Hello World!'
>>> message
Hello World!
```

**Variable names**
- Variable names can be as long as you like. They can contain both letters and numbers.
- But they canâ€™t begin with a number. 
- It is legal to use uppercase letters, but it is conventional to use only lower case for variables names.
- The underscore character, _ , can appear in a name. It is often used in names with multiple words, such as *your_name* or *my_score*.

## 5. Strings



<font color="#92d050">Formating Strings</font>
- Probably the most elegant way to use strings would be as follows:
	```python
	# Ask the user for their name
	name = input("What's your name? ")
	print(f"hello, {name}")
	```
